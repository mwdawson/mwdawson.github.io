## Projects

I've been involved in a number of projects ranging from Alzheimer's Disease to Mount Everest to Major League Baseball. Here are a few brief descriptions.

### Recent Research Projects

- [Dynamic Modeling of Conditional Quantile Trajectories](https://github.com/mwdawson/Conditional-Quantile-Trajectories/blob/master/README.md#conditional-quantile-trajectories): A new dyanmic perspective on longitudinal quantiles.
 
- [Small Cluster Identification in Large Genomes](https://github.com/mwdawson/Gene-Clustering#gene-clustering): Methods for small-scale gene cluster discovery in large genomes.
