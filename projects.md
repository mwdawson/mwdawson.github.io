## Projects

I've been involved in a number of projects ranging from Alzheimer's Disease to Mount Everest to Major League Baseball. Here are a few brief descriptions.

### Conditional Quantile Trajectories

Some longitudinal data is only observed over a very short period of time for each subject. This makes modeling difficult for a number of reasons, one of which being that the covariance matrix/function is not estimable. This project involves taking advantage of linear information in very short segments to construct quantile trajectories using an ordinary differential equation. The key application is to Alzheimer's disease, where modeling over time is crucial, but obtaining long-term measurements is costly and invasive.

### Small Cluster Identification in Large Genomes

It is well-known that in the human genome there exist large clusters of genes which are separated by vast geneless regions. There is evidence of a similar phenomenon in large plant genomes, such as the recently seqenced *Aegilops tauschii*. One difference, however, is that in this genome, the clusters seem to be on a very small scale (on the order of 2-3 genes per cluster in a sea of many thousands of genes). The aim of this project is to discover so-called gene islands, or *insulae* without choosing cluster parameters (e.g. number of clusters, genes per cluster) a priori.
