### Skills

**Applied Statistics and Machine Learning**

I'm very experienced, both in theory and in practice, with tools in Applied Statistics and Machine Learning. Without giving a complete laundry list, this includes standard methods like (generalized) linear models and variants, statistical testing, dimension reduction, machine learning models for classification, feature/metric engineering, and model validation. I also have expertise in longitudinal and functional data analysis.

**Programming**

For data analysis my primary language is R, though I'm also familiar with Python. I also have some experience with SQL, Hive, C++, Go, and JavaScript.

**"Soft" Skills**

My communication skills are strong, as it has always been a crucial part of my job to explain technical results to non-technical stakeholders. I've also taught courses at the university level and given presentations at conferences and meetings. I'm used to working independently on projects, but I think cooperation between teams/members is crucial in data science.
