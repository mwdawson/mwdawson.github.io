### Skills

#### Applied Statistics and Machine Learning

I'm very experienced (both in theory and in practice) with tools in Applied Statistics and Machine Learning. Without giving a complete laundry list, this includes standard methods like (mixed) (generalized) linear models, statistical testing, dimension reduction, and tree-based methods. I also have expertise in longitudinal and functional data analysis.

#### Programming

For data analysis my primary language is R, though I'm also familiar with Python. I have some experience with SQL, Hive, C++, and JavaScript.

#### Communication

My communication skills are strong, as it has always been a crucial part of my job to explain technical results to non-technical stakeholders. I've also taught courses at the university level and given presentations at conferences and meetings.
